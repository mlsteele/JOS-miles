# Question 1
How did you structure your transmit implementation? In particular, what do you do if the transmit ring is full?

My transmit implementation drops the packet if the ring is full. It alerts the user to this fact using a return from the driver (and syscall). The user process using the system interface is responsible for checking whether their packet succeeded completely if they care.
The return status is set up so as not to disturb users who don't care if a packet is dropped. A positive value (length of the packet) means complete success, a zero means a dropped packet (still somewhat a success), and a negative value indicates utter disaster.
