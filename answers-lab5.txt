# Question 1
Do you have to do anything else to ensure that this (fs IOPL) I/O privilege setting is saved and restored properly when you subsequently switch from one environment to another? Why?

No, the eflags register is preserved by traps and reloaded for the new environment by env_run every time the processor changes between processes.
